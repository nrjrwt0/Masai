Input
Input Format

First line: Three integers n, m and s, where n denotes the number of rows, m denotes the number of columns in the matrix and s is the sum.

Next n lines: Each line contains m characters which contain positive integers only.

Constraints

1 <= n,m < 10

1 <= s <= 50


Output
Print the number of times the sum s appear in the matrix.


Sample Input 1 

3 3 6
3 2 1
2 2 2
1 5 1
Sample Output 1

4
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

here s is 6 presents 4 times( 2 Horizontal + 1 Vertical + 1 Diagonal)












2D Array and Product
Description

You are given an array of n rows, m columns which contains positive integers and  product P

You need to find occurrences of the product of three consecutive numbers (i.e x,y, and z )whose product is equal to given P appear horizontally, vertically and diagonally in the given matrix.

Input
Input Format

First line: Three integers n, m and P where n denotes the number of rows, m denotes the number of columns in the matrix and P is the product.

Next line: Each line contains m characters which contain positive integers only.

Constraints

1< = n,m < 10

1<= P <=100




Output
Print the number of times the product p appears in the matrix


Sample Input 1 

3 3 6
3 2 1
2 2 2
1 5 1
Sample Output 1

3
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

The product P 6 presents 3 times in the matrix(1 Horizontal +1 Vertical + 1 Diagonal)








Conditional Matrix Sum
Description

You are given a matrix(2 dimensional array) of integers of n rows and m columns. Your task is to write a program that calculates sum of all such integers present in the matrix which are divisible by 3.


Input
Input Format

First line contains n and m.

In the next n lines, there are m integers in each line which makes up elements of matrix.

Constraints

n<100

m<100


Output
Output Format

Output one number which is the sum of all such integers which are divisible by 3.


Sample Input 1 

2 3
3 1 8
2 6 0
Sample Output 1

9
Hint

The given 2 dimensional array has 2 rows and 3 columns.

There are two integers present in this array which are divisible by 3 (those are 3 and 6). So, the output is 9.
