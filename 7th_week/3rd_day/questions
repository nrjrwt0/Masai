String Prototype Submitted
Problem
write a method on String.prototype that will reverse the string you provide.
suppose, var str='masai', on using str.reverse(), it should output 'iasam'
first write your own function that can reverse a string. see how you can use loop for that.
once function is done, see how you can add that function to String.prototype so every string can use it like str.reverse()
