Motu to Potlu house
Description

Motu decided to visit his friend Potlu. It turned out that the Motu's house is located at point 0 and his friend's house is located at point x (x > 0) of the coordinate line. In one step the Motu can move 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 positions forward.

Determine, what is the minimum number of steps he need to make in order to get to his friend's house.


Input
Input Format :

First and the only line contain the integer n which denotes the position of his friend's house.

Constraints :

1 <= n <= 10^6


Output
Output contains a single line denoting the minimum number of steps.
