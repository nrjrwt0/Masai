You can't use any style tags for any of the html tags and you have to use classes and ids to apply the styles, keep the usage of ids to minimal and optimise the usage of classes by using multiple classes
HINT: Using CSS in HTML file

<head>
    <style type="text/css">
        .class1 {

        }
        #id2  {

        }
    </style>
</head>
Use Box Model to build the layout

Create a file called registration.html
The layout should look like the given template https://masai-course.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/templates/css/registration.jpg
