File


















JS DOM
Country Continent Pending
Problem
Create an country_continent.html file. With a select field (having country options) and a button You must fill in valid id and other attributes for elements to make the buttons work.

Within the select you must have the following options, the options must also have the same value as given below:

India
United States of America
China
Nepal
Australia
France
Germany
South Africa
Nigeria
Mexico
Argentina
Brazil
Canada
Singapore
Sweden
eg:

<select id = "continent_select">
    <option value = "India"> India </option>    
</select>
Now using Javascript do the following:

When the button Find continent is clicked, you must output an alert on the page which contains the text The continent is <name of continent>
Eg: If the input is India -> The continent is Asia
If the input is Argentina -> The continent is South America
This link https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_continents shows you the continents for each country if you are unsure.

Hint: Use a Switch statement!
