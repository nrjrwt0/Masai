Stock it up
Description

Due to recent pandemic announcement we need to make a stock requirement generator, where all the items required for a week with price are given.

For one week:

1. Flour = 5kg| Price = 110 per kg

2. Rice = 2kg| Price = 120 per kg

3. Sugar = 2kg| Price = 42 per kg

4. Pulse = 3kg| Price = 53 per kg

5. Bread = 2 packet | Price = 40 per packet

6. Milk = 5 litre| Price = 32 per litre

7. Oil = 2 litre| Price = 126 per litre

The user will give N number of weeks for stock calculation with a list of 7 elements with 0 and 1 representing each item in the list, if the element is 0 then that item is not required by the person.

The output should be the overall cost of the items for that number of weeks.

Problem
You can't use any style tags for any of the html tags and you have to use classes, ids and combinators to apply the styles, keep the usage of ids to minimal and optimise the usage of classes by using multiple classes and combinators
HINT: Using CSS in HTML file

<head>
    <style type="text/css">
        .class1 {

        }
        #id2  {

        }
    </style>
</head>
Use Box Model to build the layout

Create a file called periodic_table.html
The layout should look like the given template https://masai-course.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/resources/templates/css/periodic_table.jpg
