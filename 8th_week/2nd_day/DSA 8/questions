 Simple Pattern Drawing
Description

You have to write code that draws a Snake for you according to the following rules:

A snake is a pattern on a n by m table. Denote c-th cell of r-th row as (r, c). The tail of the snake is located at (1, 1), then it's body extends to (1, m), then goes down 2 rows to (3, m), then goes left to (3, 1) and so on.

The empty cells should be represented as dot characters ('.') and the snake cells should be filled with number signs ('#').

Consider sample tests in order to understand the snake pattern.

Consecutive Even
Description

Given an array A with n integers, find out whether if there exist three consecutive elements in the given array which are even.

Print "Yes" if exists, else "No".


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the array A.

The second line of each test case contains n integers (1 ≤ Ai ≤1000).


Output
For each test case, print the answer.

Human Readable Time
Description

Given number of minutes, convert it into human readable form.

Example:

130 becomes 2hrs 10minutes

110 becomes 1hr 50minutes

120 becomes 2hrs 00minutes

Note the exact format of output

If number of hour is 1 then output would be hr and not hrs

In case there are exact number of hours (like 120 minutes), keep minutes as 00

Keep minutes always in plural form even if it is 1 (singular)


Input
Input Format

First and only line of input contains a number which is total time in minutes that needs to be converted into human readable form.

Constraints

65<= input < 10000 minutes


Output
Output Format

Output the string in correct format as per following rules:

1. If number of hour is 1 then output would be hr and not hrs

2. In case there are exact number of hours (like 120 minutes), keep minutes as 00

3. Keep minutes always in plural form even if it is 1 (singular)

4. There is exactly one space between hours reading and minutes reading


Sample Input 1 

135
Sample Output 1

2hrs 15mins






Count Possible Pairs
Description

You are given a system of equations:

x^2 + y = n

y^2 + x = m

You have to count, how many there are pairs of integers (x, y) (0 ≤ x, y) which satisfy the system.


Input
Input Format :

A single line contains two integers n, m

Constraints :

1 ≤ n, m ≤ 1000


Output
On a single line print the count

9 3
Sample Output 1

1
Hint

Output Explanation :

In the first sample the suitable pair is integers (3, 0)









Result or Tie - Tic Tac Toe
Description

You are given a 3*3 matrix (2-dimensional array) that represents the final situation of a Tic Tac Toe.

Your task is to write a program that finds out the winner in case the match ended in a win. If the winner is 'x', print 'x'(without quotes).

If the winner is 'o', print 'o' (without quotes)

In case the match ended in a tie, print "Tie" (without quotes)


Input
InputFormat

The input contains 3 lines where each line has 3 space separated characters which represent the final status of tic tac toe

Constraints

The input contains either of the 2 alphabets: 'x' and 'o'


Output
Print Tie/x/o depending on the end result of the game.


Sample Input 1 

x o x
o x x
o o o
Sample Output 1

o`









Conditional Matrix Sum
Description

You are given a matrix(2 dimensional array) of integers of n rows and m columns. Your task is to write a program that calculates sum of all such integers present in the matrix which are divisible by 3.


Input
Input Format

First line contains n and m.

In the next n lines, there are m integers in each line which makes up elements of matrix.

Constraints

n<100

m<100


Output
Output Format

Output one number which is the sum of all such integers which are divisible by 3.


Sample Input 1 

2 3
3 1 8
2 6 0

Hint

The given 2 dimensional array has 2 rows and 3 columns.









Transpose the Matrix
Description

The transpose of a matrix is an operator which flips a matrix over its diagonal, that is it switches the row and column of the matrix by producing another matrix.

See sample test case for better understanding

So, given an array of n rows and m columns, generate the transpose of the matrix.


Input
Input Format:

First line contains two integers n and m

Next n lines contain m integers which represents each row of 2d array

Constraints:

n,m <= 500


Output
Print the transposed array
