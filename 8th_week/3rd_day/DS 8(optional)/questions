Power of 2
Description

Given an integer N, check if the number is power of 2 or not.

Note : You may not use any inbuilt function.


Input
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The first and the only line of each test case contains N, the number to be checked.

Constraints :

-2^31<= n <= 2^31- 1

Output
Print "True", if the number is a power of 2, else print "False".


Sample Input 1 

2
2
3
Sample Output 1

True
False
Hint

In the sample test case, the first number 2 is a power of 2 while the number 3 is not a power of 2. Therefore, the output is True, and for 3 the output is False.










Vowels Priority
Description

Given a string s, rearrange the string in such a way that all the vowels appear at the beginning of the string.

The relative order between vowels remains the same and the relative order between consonants also remains the same.

Please look at the sample testcases for more clarity.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10000) — the length of the string.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The final rearranged string.
