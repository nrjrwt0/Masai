Constructor Function Pending
Problem
Create multiple tasks using constructor function. Make sure to comment each line describing what it's doing.Statement

create a constructor Task
it will accept only title for creating the object
it will create an object with the following properties
title < string >
status ( default value - false )
created_date
Approach

create a constructor Task (keep first letter capital, so that others know its a constructor)
accept title in function
create title, status, and created_date fields
function Task( title ) {
  this.title = title
  this.status = false
  this.created_date = new Date()
}
var task = new Task( "buy milk") ```
