Local Storage Counter Submitted
Problem
create 2 buttons increaseand decrease and one h1
on clicking the increase button the value of the counter should increase by 1
on clicking the decrease button the value of the counter should decrease by 1
show the current counter value in the h1 tag
the data should be saved in the localStorage with the key called counter
on refresh the counter should show the data which was already there
the page should not throw an error when refreshed even if data in localstorage is empty, instead inform the counter is null (show this message on the dom)
