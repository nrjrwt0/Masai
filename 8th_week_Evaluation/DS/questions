Longest Repeated Odd
Description

You are given an array A of N integers. Your task is to find the maximum number of times an odd number is continuously repeated in the array.


Input
Input Format

First line contains N which is the number of element present in the array.

Second line contains N integers which are the values of array.

Constraints

N<100


Output
Output Format

Output one integer which the maximum number of times an odd number is repeated in array.


Sample Input 1 

12
1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1
Sample Output 1

4
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

1 is repeated 4 times from index 0 to index 3 => 4 times

2 is repeated 5 times from index 4 to index 8 => 5 times

1 is repeated 3 times from index 9 to index 11 => 3 times

So, the output is 4 since 1 is odd.
