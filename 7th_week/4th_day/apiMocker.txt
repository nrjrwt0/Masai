}

METHOD:POST

{
  "password": "neerajrawatnt",
  "username": "neerajrawatnt"
}



then we will get a token no
in my case: d466bc85ca2df8a96d9d0d1157576cb



METHOD:GET
and on putting that token in Auth (type: Bearer Token)

we will get all the data which we have submitted at time of registeration.

in my case:
{"description": "neeraj rawat", "token": "d466bc85ca2df8a96d9d0d1157576cb0", "email": "neerajrawatnt@masai.com", "mobile": "9292929292", "username": "neerajrawatnt", "name": "neerajrawatnt"}
