Sum of Special Pairs
Description

You are given an array A of N integers. Write a program to find the sum of the absolute difference between all such pairs (A[i], A[j]) such that i < j and ( j-i ) is prime.


Input
Input Format :

First line contains N

Second line contains N space separated integers which are elements of A

Constraints :

N<1000


Output
Output one number as per condition mentioned above


Sample Input 1 

6
1 2 3 5 7 12
Sample Output 1

45
Hint

Explanation to sample test case



All valid index pairs are:
(5, 0) -> abs(12 – 1) = 11
(3, 0) -> abs(5 – 1) = 4
(2, 0) -> abs(3 – 1) = 2
(4, 1) -> abs(7 – 2) = 5
(3, 1) -> abs(5 – 2) = 3
(5, 2) -> abs(12 – 3) = 9
(4, 2) -> abs(7 – 3) = 4
(5, 3) -> abs(12 – 5) = 7
11 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 7 = 45

Count consonants
Description

Given a 2D array with N rows and M columns containing lowercase alphabets. Given a pattern containing the array elements in V shape, starting from the top right corner and ending up at the bottom right corner as given below:

prob2.png

Calculate the number of consonants that are contained in the V shape.

Note - Assume 1-based indexing.


Input
First line: Single integer denoting the value of T - the number of test cases.

For each test case:

First line: Two single space-separated integers denoting the value of N and M.

N lines follow:

Each of the lines consists of M single space-separated characters, denoting a row of a matrix.

Constraints:

1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N,M <= 100


Output
For each test case, print in a new line, a single integer denoting the number of consonants that are contained in the V shape. If it is not possible to traverse the V shape, print -1.

-1
Hint

You are to print the sum of elements of matrix which are at following positions:

(1,M),(2,M-1),(3,M-2), ........, (M-1,2), (M,1), (M+1,2),(M+2,3), ......, (N,M).

Given test cases,

Test 1:
N = 3, M = 2, and given 2D array:

a a
b b
c c

Elements at required positions:
(1,2) - a, (2,1) - b, (3,2) - c.
Hence the number of consonants is 2.

Test 2:
Elements at required positions:
(1,2) - a, (2,1) - b.
There are no elements to be traversed further, hence you can't reach the bottom right corner of the array. Hence the answer is -1.
