=> If total marks of both the students are same, then the one having more marks in Maths wins. In case their marks in maths are also same, the one whose marks in Physics is more wins the game.


Input
Input Format :
First line of input contains 3 space separated integers which is the marks in physics, chemistry and mathematics respectively of first student

Second line of input contains 3 space separated integers which is the marks in physics, chemistry and mathematics respectively of second student



Constraints :

Marks < 36000


Output
Output "First" (without quotes) if first student wins.

In all other case print "Second"


Sample Input 1 

120 90 70
