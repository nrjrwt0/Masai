Apply Basic Maths
Description

Given, an array A (index starting from 0) with N elements. You CAN remove only that element which makes the sum of ALL the remaining elements exactly divisible by 7.

Your task is to find the first array index of the smallest element that can be removed.


Input
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N.

Next line contains N space separated integers A[k] , 0 < k < N - 0 based indexing

Constraints

1 < N < 100000

0 < A[k] < 1000000000




Output
Output Format

Print a single line containing one integer, the first array index of the smallest element that CAN be removed, and -1 if there is no such element that he can remove!


Sample Input 1 

5
14 7 8 2 4
Sample Output 1

1
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

Both 14 and 7 are valid answers, but since 7 is the smallest, the required array index is 1.








Detect Palindrome
Description

Given an integer, print "Yes" (without quotes) if that integer is aPalindrome, else print "No" (without quotes)

You must not use the reverse() function. Using that would lead to disqualification


Input
Input Format

You are provided with one integer.

Constraints

The provided integer is always lesser than 1000000


Output
Print Yes or No depending upon the integer.


Sample Input 1 

1221
Sample Output 1

Yes
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

Reading 1221 from either side is same, so Yes, it is a palindrome.








Count Consonant
Description

You are provided a string S. Your task is to write a program that counts the number of consonants (non-vowels characters) present in the string.


Input
Input Format:

First-line contains a string S

Constraints:

Length of String is always lesser than 1000


Output
Output one number which is the count of number of consonants present in the string.


Sample Input 1 

masaischool
Sample Output 1

6







Masai Sentence Reversal
Description

You are provided with a sentence S, your task is to write a program that reverses the order/sequence in which words are present in the sentence keeping the case of each character preserved (upper case character should remain upper and lower case character is lower case). (Refer to the sample test case for better understanding)

Try using the stack data structure

DO NOT ANY BUILT-IN FUNCTION FOR REVERSING A STRING


Input
Input Format

You are provided with a sentence having one or more than one word.

Constraints

At least one word is present in the string




Output
Output the sentence by reversing the sequence of words


Sample Input 1 

A Transformation in education
Sample Output 1

education in Transformation A
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

The sentence has been reversed in the sense that the sequence in which the words were present in the initial sentence is reversed.

Also, there is no change in the case of characters present in the sentence.









Sum of Special Pairs
Description

You are given an array A of N integers. Write a program to find the sum of the absolute difference between all such pairs (A[i], A[j]) such that i < j and ( j-i ) is prime.


Input
Input Format :

First line contains N

Second line contains N space separated integers which are elements of A

Constraints :

N<1000


Output
Output one number as per condition mentioned above


Sample Input 1 

6
1 2 3 5 7 12
Sample Output 1

45
Hint

All valid index pairs are:
(5, 0) -> abs(12 – 1) = 11
(3, 0) -> abs(5 – 1) = 4
(2, 0) -> abs(3 – 1) = 2
(4, 1) -> abs(7 – 2) = 5
(3, 1) -> abs(5 – 2) = 3
(5, 2) -> abs(12 – 3) = 9
(4, 2) -> abs(7 – 3) = 4
(5, 3) -> abs(12 – 5) = 7
11 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 4 + 7 = 45






Masai Palindromic Substring
Description

You are provided a string S. Write a program that returns length of the longest palindromic substring of that string.


Input
Input Format

You are provided with a string

Constraints

Length of string < 100


Output
Output Format

Output one number which is length of the longest substring which is a palindrome


Sample Input 1 

thisracecarisgood
Sample Output 1

7
Hint

Sample 1 Explanation

The given string contains a palindromic substring which is, "racecar" and it is of largest length(7) among all other palindromic substrings. Hence the output is 7







Magic Numbers!
Description

You are given a numbern. A number is said to be magical if it contains magic digits 4 and 7 only.For example 77,47,74,474 are magical and 5,467,17 are not.

The number isalmostmagicalifit is divisible by one of the magic numbers.

print "YES" (without the quotes), if number n is almost lucky. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
